Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a type of post-quantum encryption which allows computation of encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first. However, to encrypt data securely, it makes use of errors that accumulate when performing operations on ciphertexts. Reducing the amount of errors in a ciphertext, known as bootstrapping, is possible, but at a large computational cost. Considering that FHE has numerous potential applications in domains that revolve around privacy, much effort has been made over the last 15 years to either improve the efficiency of bootstrapping or reduce the number of times it has to be executed. 
The addition of errors in ciphertexts can also place restrictions on the values that can be encrypted to ensure that these errors can be correctly removed when decrypting.
These restrictions come in the form of a quantization, ultimately limiting the precision of computations when using real numbers. 

This thesis first shows how the use of error correcting techniques from coding theory can help improve control over the error growth in established fully homomorphic schemes, reducing the number of bootstrapping operations. The second part of this thesis revisits the implementation of the TFHE cryptosystem (Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus), to improve the precision of computations with fixed-point numbers; and delivers an example of how this can be used for privacy-preserving machine learning.
